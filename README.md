### Unique Features:
* **NoxxLFM/LFG** - *Construct and post messages that dynamically update as you build your group.*
* **Quick-Glance Icons** - *Quickly find what you need by using at-a-glance icons like gold/silver amount for travel or role icons for raid/dungeon finding!*
* **Specific Categories** - *Use specific categories to keep the LFG frame small and focused on a specific type of group you're trying to find.*
* **Performance Focused** - *By default, NoxxLFG will not log groups or posts unless you are using it, reserving your memory for more important things.*
