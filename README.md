# Official Repository for NoxxLFG
<sup>World of Warcraft: Season of Discovery Addon by Noxxious</sup>

Find NoxxLFG on CurseForge @ https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/noxxlfg

**Current Stable Version:** 1.3.21\
*Development Version:* 1.4.0

#### Development Version Updates
**v1.4.0 Updates**
* The LFG Tool (message constructor) is now available. Construct simple LFG requests and post to your set channel (or LookingForGroup by default) every 30 seconds as normal.
* Ragefire Chasm color changed slightly.
* Yell and Say are now valid channels when NoxxLFG parses messages. This is extra and does not need to be added to the settings.
* UI text updates.
* Addition of valid parses for Nightmare Incursions.
* Introduction of a proper debug mode using the "/nlfgdebug" command. Using this command prevents the sending of global messages and instead whispers yourself with your message, as well as displaying various other information.

**TODO/WIP**
* **WIP:** Role filtering in Dungeons/Raids/Events & PvP categories.
* **TODO:** Support the selection/linking of quests in the LFG Tool.
* **TODO:** Ability to shift-click and link quests to your LFG message.

### Unique Features:
* **NoxxLFM/LFG** - *Construct and post messages that dynamically update as you build your group.*
* **Quick-Glance Icons** - *Quickly find what you need by using at-a-glance icons like gold/silver amount for travel or role icons for raid/dungeon finding!*
* **Categories** - *Select the specific category you need to keep the LFG frame light and focused on a specific type of group you're trying to find.*
* **Performance Focused** - *By default, NoxxLFG will not log groups or posts unless you are using it, reserving your memory for more important things. This can be disabled in the settings.*
